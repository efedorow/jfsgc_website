                        Dr. Fedorowich is a professional structural geologist with over 26 years of experience in structural characterization and modelling at operating underground and open pit mines. 
                        His areas of specialization are kinematic and dynamic analysis of structures and patterns, target generation, structure and ore resource 3D modeling, and geophysical and remote sensing methods as applied to detecting mineralization and structures. 
                        He has designed and executed projects in a wide variety of international settings.
                        These have incorporated DGPS structural mapping, lineament analysis, descriptive core logging, and ATV OPTV televiewer logging to understand and model the geometry and patterns of faults folds veins and fractures.
                        He is a Registered Professional Geologist in Ontario, Canada.
